== Health Tracker

This is an application which allows the user to enter and review information about his/her health
and exercise habits.  This app will track the user's weight, the number of steps taken per day, calories
consumed and exercises performed.  The application's dashboard page will display the net caloric intake (that is,
the calories consumed minus calories burned through exercise.)  The dashboard will also show the number of miles the user
has walked that day and, depending on their weight, how many calories per mile they have burned.
